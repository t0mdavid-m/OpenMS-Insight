    """
    Sequence view of a protein (or peptide) with its fragment and tag evidence.

    Draws the protein sequence as a grid of residues and marks on it the matched
    fragment ions (a/b/c/x/y/z), sequence tag coverage, the selected tag,
    truncations, localized and ambiguous modifications and, with externally
    annotated fragments, internal fragments. Below the grid a table lists the matched
    fragments. Residues, fragment rows and the masses of the spectrum are linked:
    clicking one selects the others.

    Each row of data is one sequence entry (e.g. an identification) with its spectrum:

    - Sequence columns (see ``SEQUENCE_COLUMNS``): ``sequence`` (list of
      residues), ``fragment_masses_<ion>`` (per position, the theoretical
      masses), ``coverage``/``maxCoverage`` (tag coverage per residue),
      ``start_position``/``end_position`` (0-based, -1 when undetermined),
      ``theoretical_mass``, ``observed_mass`` (observed mass of the entry; its
      presence switches to the identification view with tags and truncations),
      ``modifications`` (list of {start, end, mass_diff, labels}),
      ``fixed_modifications`` (residues carrying a fixed modification),
      ``annotated_fragments`` and ``annotation_summary`` (fragments annotated
      by an external tool, see ``AnnotatedFragment`` in the Vue types),
      ``edited`` (True for an entry the user edited, see ``edit_identifier``).
    - Spectrum columns: ``mass_column`` (list of deconvolved masses) and
      ``precursor_mass_column``.

    Alternatively pass one fixed entry as ``sequence`` (a dict with the
    sequence columns); then each row of data is just a spectrum, e.g. to match
    a user-given sequence against the selected scan.

    Without annotated fragments, fragments are matched here against the
    spectrum's masses within the tolerance (ppm), honouring variable
    modifications the user sets on residues (right click). For each such
    modification the view works out from the matched fragments which residues
    it can sit on: fragments that match only with its mass shift place it
    inside them, fragments that match only without it place it outside. When
    several residues remain (or the shift fits several modifications of the
    library at those residues), the view marks the residues with a dashed
    line and lists the alternatives in the tooltip and the list of applied
    modifications; it also notes a modification the fragments place on other
    residues.

    With ``edit_identifier``, an identification can be edited: a pencil
    button asks the app to start from the search result, after which the
    residue menus, the "change sequence" dialog and a reset button write
    edits (see ``edit_identifier``).

    Example:
        view = ProteinSequenceView(
            cache_id="sequence_view",
            data=identifications,  # one row per identification
            filters={"protein": "hit_index"},

        Initialize the ProteinSequenceView component.

        Args:
            cache_id: Unique identifier for this component's cache (MANDATORY).
            data: Polars LazyFrame, one row per entry (or per spectrum when
                ``sequence`` is given). See the class docstring for columns.
            data_path: Path to a parquet file with the data.
            filters: Mapping of identifier names to column names selecting the
                row to show, e.g. {'protein': 'hit_index'}.
            filter_defaults: Default values for filters when state is None.
            interactivity: Not used; clicks set the identifiers below.
            cache_path: Base path for cache storage.
            regenerate_cache: Rebuild the cache even if a matching one exists.
            sequence: One fixed entry (dict of sequence columns) shown for
                every row of data.
            mass_column: List column with the spectrum's deconvolved masses.
                None: no spectrum (fragments only from annotated_fragments).
            precursor_mass_column: Column with the precursor mass, shown against
                the theoretical mass when no observed mass is given.
            spectrum_key_column: Column identifying the spectrum of a row (e.g.
                its scan index), sent with the matched fragments (see
                ``fragment_matches_identifier``) so a spectrum view marks them
                only on that spectrum.
            fragmentation_column: Column with the fragmentation method of the
                spectrum (a ``fragmentation`` value of ``settings``, e.g.
                'ETD' or 'HCD'; None or unknown keeps the current ion series).
                When the selected spectrum's method changes, the view selects
                that method's ion series and shows the method in the mass
                summary; not with annotated fragments, which were annotated
                for the search's ion types.
            mass_identifier: Identifier holding the selected mass, as an index
                into the masses of the spectrum (e.g. a mass table's selection).
                Selecting a fragment selects its mass and vice versa.
            aa_identifier: Identifier holding the selected residue (0-based).
                Clicking a residue covered by tags toggles it.
            sequence_identifier: Identifier the "change sequence" dialog writes a
                new sequence to. None hides the button. The app reads it and
                rebuilds the view for the new sequence.
            modification_library: Fixed modifications offered in the "change
                sequence" dialog, as dicts with ``id`` (e.g.
                ``'Carbamidomethyl (C)'``) and ``mass`` (the mass shift); a
                ``site`` key is shown when given. ``'pyopenms'`` offers every
                modification in pyOpenMS ``ModificationsDB`` (see
                ``pyopenms_modification_library``; needs pyopenms). None shows
                no picker.
            modifications_identifier: Identifier the dialog writes the ids of
                the picked modifications to (a list), before it writes the
                sequence. Needs ``modification_library``.
            modifications: Ids preselected in the picker, e.g. the fixed
                modifications the current sequence carries.
            variable_modification_library: Variable modifications the menu of
                a residue (right click) offers instead of the built-in six, in
                the form of ``modification_library`` (``'pyopenms'`` included);
                each residue and terminus lists the entries of its ``site``.
                The menu gets a search field (name or mass) and lists
                suggested modifications for the residue until something is
                typed; a list under the sequence shows the applied
                modifications with their total mass. None keeps the built-in
                menu.
            variable_modification_suggestions: Library ids suggested in the
                menu per site (a residue letter, ``'N-term'`` or
                ``'C-term'``), e.g. ``{'K': ['Acetyl (K)', 'GG (K)']}``. None
                uses built-in suggestions of common biological modifications
                and artefacts; ``{}`` suggests nothing.
            settings: Initial fragment settings, all keys optional:
                ``tolerance`` (default 10), ``tolerance_unit`` ('ppm' default,
                or 'Da'), ``ion_types`` (a b c x y z and the variants a• x•
                y-1 z•, also written a+1 x+1 z+1; default b and y) and
                ``fragmentation`` ('CID/HCD', 'ETD/ECD', 'EThcD' or 'UVPD',
                selecting that method's ion series when ``ion_types`` is not
                given), ``show_truncations`` (True default: the residues
                outside an identified proteoform are drawn greyed; False:
                each truncated terminus is marked by a break line labelled
                with the positions of those residues, whose hover text gives
                their number and the residues themselves). The user can change all of them in the view.
                See ``check_fragment_settings``.
            title: Title above the view (None: no title).
            annotation_title: Label of the ``annotation_summary`` line.
            svg_filename: File name (without extension) of the image download;
                the extension follows the image format.
            accent_color: Colour of the dialog buttons (default: the theme's
                primary colour).
            proforma_copy: Show a "Copy as ProForma" button that copies the
                shown proteoform in ProForma 2.0 notation, with its fixed,
                localized and user-set modifications.
            proforma_input: The "Change sequence" dialog also reads ProForma
                2.0: global fixed modifications (``<[Carbamidomethyl]@C>``,
                looked up in ``modification_library``), terminal and residue
                modifications by name (looked up in the libraries) or mass,
                which become the residues' variable modifications.
            uniprot_lookup: The "Change sequence" dialog gets a UniProt
                accession field: "Get sequence" asks the UniProt REST API
                (from the browser) for the entry and puts its sequence into
                the sequence field, to edit or annotate before applying.
                Accepts isoforms (``P0ACF0-2``) and FASTA identifiers
                (``sp|P0ACF0|DBHA_ECOLI``).
            proforma_identifier: Identifier holding the shown proteoform as
                ProForma 2.0, both ways, as ``{"text", "by", "n"}``: the app
                (``by="app"``) and the view's dialog (``"dialog"``) write
                numbered requests, the view answers with ``by="view"`` and the
                number of the request it shows (``proforma_text`` reads the
                text; a plain string from the app works too). The view writes it whenever its
                sequence or modifications change (in the dialog, the residue
                menus), and a ProForma (or plain sequence) the
                app writes there becomes the view's sequence, fixed and
                variable modifications. Needs ``sequence_identifier``; a text
                the view cannot read is shown as an error in the view.
            isotope_errors: Also match fragment masses that are off by up to
                this many whole isotopes (± n × 1.00235 Da), as deconvolution
                can place a monoisotopic mass. Shows a "Match isotope errors"
                switch in the view's menu, on for n > 0 (off for 0), with the
                number of isotopes starting at n; while it is on, the fragment
                table has an Isotope column. The precursor's Δ in ppm and its
                isotope reading are shown either way. None (default): no
                setting, exact matches only.
            unmatched_masses: List the observed masses that no fragment ion
                of the selected types matches as rows of the fragment table
                ('unmatched', with the nearest theoretical fragment ion and the
                differences to it; a shift shared by several masses can point
                at a modification). The table's filter dialog has a preset,
                'Hide unmatched masses', that is on by default, so the rows
                show only once the user switches it off. Clicking such a row
                selects the mass in the mass table. Not offered with annotated
                fragments. Default False.
            fragment_identifier: Identifier the selected fragment's bounds are
                written to, as {'name', 'kind' ('N', 'C' or 'I'), 'start',
                'end'} (positions in the sequence), e.g. for a
                ``ProteinStructureView``.
            edit_identifier: Identifier edits of an identification are
                written to, each a dict with ``action`` and a fresh ``nonce``
                (apply each nonce once). None (default): identifications are
                not editable. ``'edit'``: the user wants to edit the shown
                identification; the app then gives the entry with
                ``edited=True``, fragment masses of the unmodified sequence,
                no annotated fragments, and the search's modifications each
                on one residue (``start == end``). The view sets those on
                the residues, matches fragments here, and adds them to the
                theoretical mass. ``'update'``: the edited entry, with
                ``sequence`` (string), ``start_position``, ``end_position``
                and ``modifications`` (list of {start, end, mass_diff,
                labels}; -1 the N-terminus, the sequence length the
                C-terminus). ``'reset'``: back to the search result.
                Render-time only: not part of the cache.
            fragment_matches_identifier: Identifier the matched fragment
                ions are written to whenever they change (another entry or
                spectrum, an edited sequence or modification, the ion types,
                the tolerance), so spectra can mark them: a dict with
                ``spectrum`` (the value of ``spectrum_key_column``, or None),
                ``tolerance`` ({'value', 'unit'}) and ``fragments``, one dict
                per matched ion with ``name`` (e.g. 'b12'), ``ion`` (its ion
                type, e.g. 'b' or 'z+1'), ``kind`` ('N', 'C' or 'I'),
                ``mass`` (the observed mass), ``massIndex`` (its index in the
                spectrum's mass list, or None) and, for annotated fragments,
                ``charge`` and ``mz``. None while no spectrum is matched. Pass
                the same identifier to ``DeconvolvedSpectrum``. Render-time
                only: not part of the cache.
            fragment_matches_proteoform: Also write the proteoform the
                fragments were matched against to
                ``fragment_matches_identifier``, as ``proteoform``: a dict
                with ``proforma`` (the sequence with its fixed and variable
                modifications), ``sequence``, ``length``,
                ``theoreticalMass`` (with the variable modifications) and
                ``cleavagePercentage`` (the share of bonds explained by a
                matched fragment), so a page can keep the proteoforms it tried and compare them.
                Render-time only: not part of the cache.
            entry_title: Heading of the mass summary of an entry with an
                observed mass.
            observed_mass_label: Label of the entry's observed mass in that
                summary.
            float_precision: Masses are compared at ppm level, so they are kept
                as Float64 by default.
            image_format: Format of the image download: 'svg', 'png', 'jpeg'
                or 'webp'. None (default) follows
                ``openms_insight.set_image_format()`` (default 'svg') when the
                component is drawn. Render-time only: not part of the cache.
