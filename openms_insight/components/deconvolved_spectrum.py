class DeconvolvedSpectrum(BaseComponent):
    """
    Spectrum plot for charge-state deconvolution results.

    One row of data per spectrum, with list columns: the deconvolved masses and
    their intensities, the raw peaks, and for each mass the raw peaks assigned to
    it (its signal peaks). The selected mass is an index into the mass list of the
    selected spectrum, held in ``mass_identifier``.

    Views:

    - ``'deconvolved'``: the masses as sticks; the selected mass is highlighted and
      labelled with its value. Clicking a mass selects it.
    - ``'annotated'``: the raw peaks; the signal peaks of the selected mass are
      highlighted and each charge state is labelled ``z=N`` at the intensity
      weighted mean m/z of its peaks. A toolbar toggle highlights the signal peaks
      of every mass.
    - ``'ladder'``: the masses, with a sequence tag drawn as a ladder: the tag's
      masses are highlighted and labelled, and arrows between consecutive masses
      carry the residue explaining the gap (hover: the mass difference). Clicking
      a ladder mass switches to its raw peaks as in ``'annotated'``; a back button
      returns. Set the tag at render time with :meth:`set_ladder`.

    With ``fragment_matches_identifier`` set to the identifier a
    ``ProteinSequenceView`` writes its matched fragment ions to, every view
    marks those ions on the spectrum the sequence view matched: the matched
    masses (and in the m/z views their signal peaks) are coloured by the end
    of the sequence they cover (N-terminal a/b/c, C-terminal x/y/z, internal)
    and labelled with the ion's name. The marks follow the sequence view: an
    edited sequence or modification, another ion type or tolerance redraws
    them. A toolbar toggle hides them.

    In the m/z views, :meth:`set_envelope` adds the theoretical isotope envelope
    of the selected mass as open circles on its raw peaks, so the fit of the
    observed peaks can be judged by eye.

    All views share the annotation toggle, the same zoom rules (the
    view fits the highlighted masses and narrows until their labels no longer
    overlap) and SVG export.

        spectrum = DeconvolvedSpectrum(
            cache_id="deconv_spectrum",

        Initialize the DeconvolvedSpectrum component.

        Args:
            cache_id: Unique identifier for this component's cache (MANDATORY).
            data: Polars LazyFrame, one row per spectrum (see column arguments).
            data_path: Path to a parquet file with the data.
            filters: Mapping of identifier names to column names, normally
                selecting one spectrum, e.g. {'scan': 'scan_idx'}.
            filter_defaults: Default values for filters when state is None.
            interactivity: Not used; clicks set ``mass_identifier``.
            cache_path: Base path for cache storage.
            regenerate_cache: Rebuild the cache even if a matching one exists.
            view: 'deconvolved', 'annotated' or 'ladder' (see class docstring).
            mass_identifier: Selection identifier holding the index of the
                selected mass within the spectrum's mass list. None disables
                mass selection.
            mass_column: List column with the deconvolved masses.
            mass_intensity_column: List column with the mass intensities.
            peak_mz_column: List column with the raw peak m/z values. Needed for
                'annotated' and for drilling down in 'ladder'.
            peak_intensity_column: List column with the raw peak intensities.
            signal_column: List column with, per mass, the list of its signal
                peaks as [peak index, m/z, intensity, charge]. The m/z values
                must equal the raw peak m/z values they refer to.
            title: Plot title (default: the view's title).
            drilldown_title: Title while a ladder view shows the raw peaks of a
                mass (default: "Annotated Spectrum").
            styling: Colour overrides: highlightColor, selectedColor,
                unhighlightedColor, highlightHiddenColor, the fragment ion
                colours nTermColor, cTermColor and internalColor, and annotationColors
                (massButton, selectedMassButton, sequenceArrow,
                selectedSequenceArrow, background, buttonHover).
            config: Label layout overrides: xPosScalingFactor (27.5),
                xPosScalingThreshold (30).
            svg_filename: File name (without extension) of the image download;
                the extension follows the image format.
            measure: Show a "Measure" button in the mode bar (default True;
                False hides it). In measure mode, clicking two masses draws a
                bracket labelled with their difference ("Δmass 128.095 ≈ K"),
                matched to amino-acid residue masses as a neutral mass (1+
                only). Between raw peaks (the 'annotated' view, or a ladder
                drill-down) the difference is m/z and matched at 1+ and 2+. Esc
                cancels a half-finished measurement, clicking a label removes it
                and "Clear measurements" removes all; they are cleared when
                other data is plotted and are part of the image download. With
                measure mode off, clicks select masses as before. Render-time
                only: not part of the cache.
            measure_tolerance: Residue matching tolerance in Da per point
                (default 0.02); a difference matches within twice this.
            measure_residues: Extra named masses to match besides the 20
                standard residues, e.g. ``{"M(Oxidation)": 147.0354}``.
            image_format: Format of the image download: 'svg', 'png', 'jpeg'
                or 'webp'. None (default) follows
                ``openms_insight.set_image_format()`` (default 'svg') when the
                component is drawn. Render-time only: not part of the cache.
            keep_zoom: Start with the zoom pinned (default False). The pin
                button in the mode bar keeps the zoomed x range when the plot
                gets new data, e.g. when another spectrum is selected; unpinned,
                each new spectrum is shown in full. Double-click still resets
                the zoom. Render-time only: not part of the cache.
            fragment_matches_identifier: Identifier a ``ProteinSequenceView``
                writes its matched fragment ions to (its
                ``fragment_matches_identifier``). The ions are marked when the
                ``spectrum`` they were matched on equals this spectrum's value
                of its first filter column (or when either is unknown), so give
                the sequence view that column as ``spectrum_key_column``.
                Render-time only: not part of the cache.
            zoom_identifier: State identifier the plot keeps its zoom under,
                ``{"x": [lo, hi], "y": [lo, hi]}`` (default None: the zoom stays
                in the browser). The plot reports its ranges there after a zoom
                or pan and zooms to a value set there, e.g. by a saved view.
                Render-time only: not part of the cache.
