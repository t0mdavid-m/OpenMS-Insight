"""Which residues of a sequence tag lie between each pair of its masses.

A tag from de novo sequencing has one residue between neighbouring masses, but
a tag can also span gaps that hold several residues (a long tag with missing
fragment masses, as FLASHTnT reports for whole proteoforms). Its masses may run
from either end of the sequence. :func:`ladder_steps` assigns the residues to
the gaps by mass, so a ladder labels every gap with the residues it measures.

Streamlit-free, so it can be tested on its own.
